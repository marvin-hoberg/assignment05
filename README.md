This project is an assignment for the master programm Data Science in Business and Economics at Tuebingen University. 
The aim of this assignment is to get to know the standard Git workflow and to work with the ticketmaster.com API.

Therefore, we download data on German venues and map their locations using respective longitude and latitude coordinates.
To expand this work we repeat the process with some other European country (here: Austria).
